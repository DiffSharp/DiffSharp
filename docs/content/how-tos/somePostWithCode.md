Literate Markdown
=================

This file demonstrates how to write Markdown document with
embedded F# snippets that can be transformed into nice HTML.

In this case, the document itself is a valid Markdown and
you can use standard Markdown features to format the text:

 - Here is an example of unordered list and...
 - Text formatting including **bold** and _emphasis_

For more information, see the [Markdown][md] reference.

Writing F# code
---------------
In standard Markdown, you can include code snippets by
writing a block indented by four spaces and the code
snippet will be turned into a `<pre>` element. If you do
the same using Literate F# tool, the code is turned into
a nicely formatted F# snippet:

    /// The Hello World of functional languages!
    let rec factorial x =
      if x = 0 then 1
      else x * (factorial (x - 1))

    let f10 = factorial 10


Hiding code
-----------

If you want to include some code in the source code,
but omit it from the output, you can use the `hide`
command. You can also use `module=...` to specify that
the snippet should be placed in a separate module
(e.g. to avoid duplicate definitions).

    [hide, module=Hidden]
    /// This is a hidden answer
    let answer = 42

The value will be deffined in the F# code that is
processed and so you can use it from other (visible)
code and get correct tool tips:

    let answer = Hidden.answer


Including other snippets
------------------------

When writing literate programs as Markdown documents,
you can also include snippets in other languages.
These will not be colorized and processed as F#
code samples:

    [lang=csharp]
    Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");

This snippet is turned into a `pre` element with the
`lang` attribute set to `csharp`.
