This is the development branch of DiffSharp 1.0.

> **NOTE: This branch is undergoing development. It has incomplete code, functionality, and design that are likely to change without notice.**

DiffSharp is a tensor library with support for [differentiable programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming). It is designed for use in machine learning, probabilistic programming, optimization and other domains.

**Key features**

* Nested and mixed-mode differentiation
* Common optimizers, model elements, differentiable probability distributions
* F# for robust functional programming
* PyTorch familiar naming and idioms, efficient LibTorch CUDA/C++ tensors with GPU support
* Linux, macOS, Windows supported
* Use interactive notebooks in Jupyter and Visual Studio Code
* 100% open source
