DiffSharp: Automatic Differentiation Library
--------------------------------------------

DiffSharp is an [automatic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) (AD) library implemented in the F# language. It supports C# and the other [CLI languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages). The library is being developed mainly for research applications in machine learning, by [Atılım Güneş Baydin](http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~gunes/) and [Barak A. Pearlmutter](http://bcl.hamilton.ie/~barak/), within the [Brain and Computation Lab](http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/), National University of Ireland Maynooth.
