DiffSharp is an [automatic differentiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) (AD) library implemented in the F# language. It supports C# and the other [CLI languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages). The library is under active development by [Atılım Güneş Baydin](http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~gunes/) and [Barak A. Pearlmutter](http://bcl.hamilton.ie/~barak/) mainly for research applications in machine learning, as part of their work at the [Brain and Computation Lab](http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/), Hamilton Institute, National University of Ireland Maynooth.

Please visit the [project website](http://gbaydin.github.io/DiffSharp/) for detailed documentation and usage examples.
